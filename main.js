        description: "After the big three era, they have managed to stay competitive. Dwyane Wade made his way back to the Heat, but at this stage of his\
            career is nothing more than a secondary player. The Heat have some hard-nosed guys like Goran Dragic and Josh Richardson. Both are average to\
            above average at their positions, but neither present the star attributes you need to really contend deep into the playoffs. Miami brought in \
            some front court depth this offseason, drafting Bam Adebayo and Kelly Olynyk. Both looked strong, and had roles when Hassan Whiteside was injured. \
            Whiteside could be one of those wrong era guys, as he often doesn’t see the court in the fourth quarter and when teams go small. Because Erik Spolstra \
            is one heck of a coach, Miami will stay competitive with this bunch, but moves will be made under Pat Riley as they always are."};

            and got Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, and Boban Marjanovic in return. Boban is a fan favorite for everyone in the league, but not a impactful\
            player. Injuries caused the Clippers to go through guards like newborns go through diapers. Patrick Beverley and Milos Teodosic both struggled\
            with injuries, which led to a lot of time for Austin Rivers and Lou Williams. Sweet Lou is a sixth man of the year candidate, and was the best\
            part of the Clippers offense. Danilo Gallinari had an on and off year with injuries, and is a placement holder for L.A. until they start transitioning\
            more towards the future. Harris performed very well down the stretch, and isn’t the worst player to keep into the future. It is only a matter of time\
            before DeAndre Jordan finds himself out of LA, but in the meantime he is their go-to starting center."};
